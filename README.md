# dig245-final

Artist statement:

About a week before selecting a topic for the DIG-245 final, I attended a class at The Hurt Hub about SEO (search engine optimization). I was fascinated with the topic of SEO and interested in learning more about the process in-depth. I wanted to incorporate SEO into my final project, so I decided to use a metaphor in order to explain it to the masses who might not understand the finer points of search engine optimization. I chose the metaphor of the process of building a well-developed garden because, like a garden, SEO is something you must plan in advance for and perfect over time.

I wanted the project to be simple and easy to digest because what’s the point of making a project to help people understand something if it’s too complicated for them to understand? I decided to model the project after the children’s book aesthetic because children’s books are very easy for the average adult to understand and the format remains endearing to many long after they have moved on to chapter books.

The project doesn’t go too in-depth into SEO,  but that was by design. If I wanted to do a more high-level explanation of how SEO works, I wouldn’t have chosen the children’s book theme. My intended audience is people googling something along the lines of “What is SEO” for the first time, people who really aren’t interested in the nitty gritty of the whole thing just yet. Instead, they want to get their toes a little wet and learn about the main points of SEO. I think I did that, and if I did a good enough job those people will want to continue their search and exploration of SEO.
